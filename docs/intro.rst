thingstore provides hierarchical contexts for managing types of things. For example, devices in a house might be defined by two sets of fields, one set prescribed by the device type (belonging to its own inherited hierarchy), and another set prescribed by its place in an application hierarchy (the thermostat belonging to the HVAC system belonging to downstairs appartment belonging to your house).
